# Languages

AdvancedArmorStands can support multiple languages simultaneously. The language used is the language the user has set in his game settings. If that language is not available, english is the default option.

### Add custom languages

- To add a new language, navigate to the file `AdvancedArmorStands/ressources/lang.yml` in your servers plugin folder. Copy the section "default" and paste it to the bottom of the file. Replace the string "en_us" in your pasted section with your desired language string. After that replace all the english sentences with your own language.
- If you want to add a new language, consider sending it in to be added to the plugin. That way all players can benefit from it.

### Color codes in the language file

- To change the visual color of a sentence, you can use the default game color codes. But note, that you have to use a `ยง` instead of the `&` you might be used to.
